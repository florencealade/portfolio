<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<p>Here is a online portfolio with some of my current work</p>

<section>

<h2 id="manifesto">Manifesto</h2>
<img section class="manifesto" src="img/manifesto.jpg" alt="A portrait of John Baskerville" title="John Baskerville designed his famous serif typeface in 1757" />
To me a manifesto is meant to be something to live by. It should be a way for me to express myself and it should remind me of who I want to be and what I want to do in life. It should inspire me to be the best and give my all no matter what I do. It should motivate me when times get tough and I may feel like giving up.
