<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<p>Here is a online portfolio with some of my current work</p>

<h2>Manifesto</h2>

To me a manifesto is meant to be something to live by. It should be a way for me to express myself and it should remind me of who I want to be and what I want to do in life. It should inspire me to be the best and give my all no matter what I do. It should motivate me when times get tough and I may feel like giving up.

<h2>Type Specimen</h2>

I created a type specimen as I appreciated how all the letters were formed and the fact that the typeface was based on calligraphy really interested me. I’m also fond of how prevalent Palatino is in today’s world and how after many years the typeface is still timeless.
